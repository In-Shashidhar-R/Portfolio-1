### About Me

Welcome to my portfolio! This project was created as part of my journey to learn and master HTML and CSS. Through this experience, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of web design, layout techniques, and the power of responsive design. The focus of this portfolio is to showcase my skills in creating clean, interactive, and user-friendly web pages, with a particular emphasis on CSS Flexbox and other layout techniques. I’m passionate about building visually appealing and accessible websites, and this project reflects my growth as a web developer.
